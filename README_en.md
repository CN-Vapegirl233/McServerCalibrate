A Minecraft Java Edition server plugin that verifies the player's identity and password to protect your Minecraft server. Currently, the plugin can support Java version 1.20.x~1.21.x. (Only tested 1.20.1, 1.20.4, 1.21.8, please test other versions by yourself) To run the plugin, your server needs to be a plugin that supports installing plugins (such as Spigot, Bukkit, Paper) or a hybrid side (such as Mohist, Arclight).
